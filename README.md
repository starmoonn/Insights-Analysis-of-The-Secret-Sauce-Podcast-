# Insights-Analysis-of-The-Secret-Sauce-Podcast-
## Project Breakdown and Workflow
**1. Data Exploration and Cleaning**
- Explore the Data:
  - Begin by reviewing the videos table to understand its structure and identify important columns (e.g., episode titles, views, duration, production year).
  - Analyze unique channels to understand distribution and identify any irregularities in the data.
- Clean the Data:
  - Filter the data by episode titles to focus on specific series or shows.
  - Convert and transform columns for better analysis (e.g., convert duration to seconds, extract year from date).
  - Handle missing or outlier values that could skew analysis.
**2. Key Metrics and Trends**
- Categorize Episodes:
  - Organize episodes into various duration ranges (e.g., short, medium, long) to identify if episode length influences viewership.
- Analyze Production and Viewership Trends:
  - Assess how episode viewership has changed over time, analyzing whether longer or shorter durations correlate with higher viewership.
- Compare Shows:
  - Specifically compare the average views for two shows, "The Secret Sauce" and "Executive Espresso", to see how these different series performed relative to each other.
**3. Business Insights and Correlations**
- Correlations Analysis:
  - Analyze correlations between YouTube views and Podbean downloads to determine if there's a relationship between video performance on YouTube and podcast performance on Podbean.
- Industry Analysis:
  - Categorize episodes into different industries (e.g., Business, Technology, Entertainment).
  - Identify high-performing categories based on average views to provide insights into which content types tend to perform the best.
